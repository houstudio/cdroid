.SH NAME
\fBplstar\fP - Initialization
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplstar\fP(\fInx\fP, \fIny\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Initializing the plotting package.  The program prompts for the device keyword or number of the desired output device.  Hitting a RETURN in response to the prompt is the same as selecting the first device.  If only one device is enabled when PLplot is installed, \fBplstar\fP(3plplot) will issue no prompt.  The output device is divided into \fInx\fP by \fIny\fP subpages, each of which may be used independently.  The subroutine \fBpladv\fP(3plplot) is used to advance from one subpage to the next.
.P
Redacted form: \fBplstar(nx, ny)\fP
