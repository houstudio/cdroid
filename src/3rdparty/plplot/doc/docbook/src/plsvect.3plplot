.SH NAME
\fBplsvect\fP - Set arrow style for vector plots
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsvect\fP(\fIarrowx\fP, \fIarrowy\fP, \fInpts\fP, \fIfill\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set the style for the arrow used by \fBplvect\fP(3plplot) to plot vectors.
.P
Redacted form: \fBplsvect(arrowx, arrowy, fill)\fP
.P
This function is used in example 22.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIarrowx, arrowy\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A pair of vectors containing the x and y points which make up the arrow. The arrow is plotted by joining these points to form a polygon. The scaling assumes that the x and y points in the arrow lie in the range -0.5 <= x,y <= 0.5. If both \fIarrowx\fP and \fIarrowy\fP are NULL then the arrow style will be reset to its default.
.TP
\fInpts\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of points in the vectors \fIarrowx\fP and \fIarrowy\fP.
.TP
\fIfill\fP (\fBPLBOOL\fP(3plplot), input)
If \fIfill\fP is true then the arrow is closed, if \fIfill\fP is false then the arrow is open.
