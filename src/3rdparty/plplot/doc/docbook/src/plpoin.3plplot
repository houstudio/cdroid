.SH NAME
\fBplpoin\fP - Plot a glyph at the specified points
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplpoin\fP(\fIn\fP, \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, \fIcode\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Plot a glyph at the specified points.  (This function is largely superseded by \fBplstring\fP(3plplot) which gives access to many[!] more glyphs.) \fIcode\fP=-1  means try to just draw a point.  Right now it's just a move and a draw at the same place.  Not ideal, since a sufficiently intelligent output device may optimize it away, or there may be faster ways of doing it.  This is OK for now, though, and offers a 4X speedup over drawing a Hershey font "point" (which is actually diamond shaped and therefore takes 4 strokes to draw).  If 0 < code < 32, then a useful (but small subset) of Hershey symbols is plotted.  If 32 <= code <= 127 the corresponding printable ASCII character is plotted.
.P
Redacted form: \fBplpoin(x, y, code)\fP
.P
This function is used in examples 1, 6, 14, and 29.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIn\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of points in the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP vectors.
.TP
\fIx\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the x coordinates of points.
.TP
\fIy\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the y coordinates of points.
.TP
\fIcode\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Hershey symbol code (in "ascii-indexed" form with -1 <= code <= 127) corresponding to a glyph to be plotted at each of the \fIn\fP points.
