.SH NAME
\fBplctime\fP - Calculate continuous time from broken-down time for the current stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplctime\fP(\fIyear\fP, \fImonth\fP, \fIday\fP, \fIhour\fP, \fImin\fP, \fIsec\fP, \fIctime\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Calculate continuous time, \fIctime\fP, from broken-down time for the current stream.  The broken-down
time is specified by the following parameters: \fIyear\fP, \fImonth\fP, \fIday\fP, \fIhour\fP, \fImin\fP, and \fIsec\fP. This function is the inverse of \fBplbtime\fP(3plplot).
.P
The PLplot definition of broken-down time is a calendar time that completely ignores all time zone offsets, i.e., it is the user's responsibility to apply those offsets (if so desired) before using the PLplot time API.  By default broken-down time is defined using the proleptic Gregorian calendar without the insertion of leap seconds and continuous time is defined as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. However, other definitions of broken-down and continuous time are possible, see \fBplconfigtime\fP(3plplot) which specifies that transformation for the current stream.
.P
Redacted form: General: \fBplctime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec, ctime)\fP

.P
This function is used in example 29.
