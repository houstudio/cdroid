.SH NAME
\fBplpat\fP - Set area line fill pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplpat\fP(\fInlin\fP, \fIinc\fP, \fIdel\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Sets the area line fill pattern to be used, e.g., for calls to \fBplfill\fP(3plplot). The pattern consists of 1 or 2 sets of parallel lines with specified inclinations and spacings.  The arguments to this routine are the number of sets to use (1 or 2) followed by two vectors (with 1 or 2 elements) specifying the inclinations in tenths of a degree and the spacing in micrometers.  (See also \fBplpsty\fP(3plplot))
.P
Redacted form: General: \fBplpat(inc, del)\fP

.P
This function is used in example 15.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fInlin\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of sets of lines making up the pattern, either 1 or 2.
.TP
\fIinc\fP (\fBPLINT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing \fInlin\fP values of the inclination in tenths of a degree.  (Should be between -900 and 900).
.TP
\fIdel\fP (\fBPLINT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing \fInlin\fP values of the spacing in micrometers between the lines making up the pattern.
