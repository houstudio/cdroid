    creating scientific plots whose (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.utf-8.com/" target="_top">UTF-8</a>) plot symbols and text are
    limited in practice only by what <a class="ulink" href="http://www.utf-8.com/" target="_top">Unicode</a>-aware system fonts are
    installed on a user's computer. The PLplot software, which is
    primarily licensed under <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_top">the LGPL</a>, has a
    clean architecture that is organized as a core C library, separate
    language <a class="link" href="features.html#features-bindings" title="Language Bindings">bindings</a> for that library,
    and separate device drivers that are dynamically
    loaded by the core library which control how the plots are presented
    in <a class="link" href="features.html#features-noninteractive" title="Output File Formats">noninteractive</a> and <a class="link" href="features.html#features-interactive" title="Interactive Platforms">interactive</a> plotting
    contexts.</p><p>The PLplot core library can be used to create standard x-y
    plots, semi-log plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots,
    mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or
    different sizes) may be placed on a single page, and multiple pages
    are allowed for those device formats that support them.</p><p> PLplot has core library support for plot symbols and text
    specified by the user in the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode. This means for
    our many Unicode-aware devices that plot symbols and text are only
    limited by the collection of glyphs normally available via installed
    system fonts. Furthermore, a large subset of our Unicode-aware devices
    also support complex text layout (CTL) languages such as Arabic,
    Hebrew, and Indic and Indic-derived CTL scripts such as Devanagari,
    Thai, Lao, and Tibetan. Thus, for these PLplot devices essentially any
    language that is supported by Unicode and installed system fonts can
    be used to label plots.</p><p>
      PLplot was originally developed by Sze Tan of the University of
      Auckland in Fortran-77.  Many of the underlying concepts used in the
      PLplot package are based on ideas used in Tim Pearson's PGPLOT
      package.  Sze Tan writes:
      </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	  I'm rather amazed how far PLPLOT has travelled given its origins
	  etc. I first used PGPLOT on the Starlink VAX computers while I was
	  a graduate student at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in
	  Cambridge from 1983-1987. At the beginning of 1986, I was to give a
	  seminar within the department at which I wanted to have a computer
	  graphics demonstration on an IBM PC which was connected to a
	  completely non-standard graphics card. Having about a week to do
	  this and not having any drivers for the card, I started from the
	  back end and designed PLPLOT to be such that one only needed to be
	  able to draw a line or a dot on the screen in order to do arbitrary
	  graphics.  The application programmer's interface was made as
	  similar as possible to PGPLOT so that I could easily port my
	  programs from the VAX to the PC.  The kernel of PLPLOT was modelled
	  on PGPLOT but the code is not derived from it.

    </p><p>The C version of PLplot was originally developed by Tony
    Richardson on a Commodore Amiga.  That version has been improved and
    expanded ever since first by Geoffrey Furnish and Maurice Lebrun in
    the 1990's and later (after the project was registered at SourceForge
    on 2000-02-23) <a class="ulink" href="http://plplot.org/credits.php" target="_top">with a much-expanded
    development team.</a></p><p>
      We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the
      form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLplot is used
      in any published papers, please include an acknowledgement or citation
      of our work, which will help us to continue improving PLplot.  Please
