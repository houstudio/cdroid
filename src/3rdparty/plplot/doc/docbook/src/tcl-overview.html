      Each of the PLplot calls available to the C or Fortran programmer are
      also available from Tcl, with the same name and generally the same
      arguments.  Thus for instance, whereas in C you can write:
      
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      plenv( 0., 1., 0., 1., 0, 0 );
      pllab( "(x)", "(y)", "The title of the graph" );
    </pre><p>
      you can now write in Tcl:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      plenv 0 1 0 1 0 0
      pllab "(x)" "(y)" "The title of the graph"
    </pre><p>
      All the normal Tcl rules apply, there is nothing special about the
      PLplot extension commands.  So, you could write the above as:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      set xmin 0; set xmax 1; set ymin 0; set ymax 1
      set just 0; set axis 0
      set xlab (x)
      set ylab (y)
      set title "The title of the graph"
      plenv $xmin $xmax $ymin $ymax $just $axis
      pllab $xlab $ylab $title
    </pre><p>
      for example.  Not that there is any reason to be loquacious for its
      own sake, of course.  The point is that you might have things like the
      plot bounds or axis labels stored in Tcl variables for some other
      reason (tied to a Tk entry widget maybe, or provided as the result of
      one of your application specific Tcl extension commands, etc), and
      just want to use standard Tcl substitution to make the PLplot calls.
    </p><p>
      Go ahead and try it!  Enter <code class="literal">pltcl</code> to start up the PLplot
      extended Tcl shell, and type (or paste) in the commands.  Or put them
      in a file and source it.  By this point it should be clear how
      incredibly easy it is to use the PLplot Tcl language binding.
    </p><p>
      In order to accommodate the ubiquitous requirement for matrix oriented
      data in scientific applications, and in the PLplot API in particular,
      PLplot includes a Tcl extension for manipulating matrices in Tcl.
      This Tcl Matrix Extension provides a straightforward and direct means
      of representing one and two dimensional matrices in Tcl.  The Tcl
      Matrix Extension is described in detail in the next section, but we
      mention its existence now just so that we can show how the PLplot Tcl
      API works.  Many of the PLplot Tcl API functions accept Tcl matrices
      as arguments.  For instance, in C you might write:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      float x[100], y[100];

      /* code to initialize x and y */

      plline( 100, x, y );
    </pre><p>
      In Tcl you can write:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      matrix x f 100
      matrix y f 100

      # code to initialize x and y

      plline x y
    </pre><p>
    N.B. Our Tcl binding uses a redacted API which is why the
    redundant dimension of the x and y arrays must be dropped from the
    plline call.
    </p><p>
      Some of the PLplot C function calls use pointer arguments to allow
      retrieval of PLplot settings.  These are implemented in Tcl by
      changing the value of the variable whose name you provide.  For
      example:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      pltcl&gt; plgxax
      wrong # args: should be "plgxax digmax digits  "
      pltcl&gt; set digmax 0
      0
      pltcl&gt; set digits 0
      0
      pltcl&gt; plgxax digmax digits
      pltcl&gt; puts "digmax=$digmax digits=$digits"
      digmax=4 digits=0
    </pre><p>
      This example shows that each PLplot Tcl command is designed to issue
      an error if you invoke it incorrectly, which in this case was used to
      remind us of the correct arguments.  We then create two Tcl variables
      to hold the results.  Then we invoke the PLplot <code class="literal">plgxax</code> function
      to obtain the label formatting information for the x axis.  And
      finally we print the results.
    </p><p>
      People familiar with Tcl culture may wonder why the <code class="literal">plg*</code> series
      functions don't just pack their results into the standard Tcl result
      string.  The reason is that the user would then have to extract the
      desired field with either <code class="literal">lindex</code> or
      <code class="literal">regexp</code>, which seems
      messy.  So instead, we designed the PLplot Tcl API to look and feel as
      much like the C API as could reasonably be managed.
    </p><p>
      In general then, you can assume that each C function is provided in
      Tcl with the same name and same arguments (and one or two dimensional
      arrays in C are replaced by Tcl matrices).  There are only a few
      exceptions to this rule, generally resulting from the complexity of
      the argument types which are passed to some functions in the C API.
      Those exceptional functions are described below, all others work in
      the obvious way (analogous to the examples above).
    </p><p>
      See the Tcl example programs for extensive demonstrations of the usage
      of the PLplot Tcl API.  To run the Tcl demos:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      % pltcl
      pltcl&gt; source tcldemos.tcl
      pltcl&gt; 1
      pltcl&gt; 2
    </pre><p>
      Alternatively, you can run <code class="literal">plserver</code> and source
      <code class="filename">tkdemos.tcl</code>.
    </p><p>
      In any event, the Tcl demos provide very good coverage of the Tcl API,
      and consequently serve as excellent examples of usage.  For the most
      part they draw the same plots as their C counterpart.  Moreover, many
      of them were constructed by literally inserting the C code into the
      Tcl source file, and performing fairly mechanical transformations on
      the source.  This should provide encouragement to anyone used to using
      PLplot through one of the compiled interfaces, that they can easily
      and rapidly become productive with PLplot in Tcl.
